# 🔐 Quantum Chemical Cipher (QCC)

Quantum Chemical Cipher (QCC) is a novel cryptographic algorithm that transforms plaintext using a 3D matrix of chemical isotopes, timestamp-driven rotation, and a salt-enhanced substitution system.

## 🚀 Features
- 256 unique "chemical" substitutions
- Timestamp-based matrix rotation
- Randomized padding for obfuscation
- Reversible encryption & decryption
- Self-contained and lightweight

## 🧠 How It Works
QCC generates a 3D matrix of 256 chemical-like identifiers, rotates it based on a timestamp sum, and encrypts text using matrix position and chain-ID substitution. Decryption is performed with the same timestamp and salt.

## 🛠 Usage

```bash
python quantumchemicalciper.py
